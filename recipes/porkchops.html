            <p>Brown some chops, then add vegetables, broth and rice. This dinner only needs one skillet, a knife, a cutting board, some measuring cups and spoons, a can opener, and a mixing and serving spoon. We like this with simple quesadillas and a salad. Add some avocado slices, if you like!</h2>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>4 boneless pork chops, about 3/4-inch thick</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons taco seasoning spice blend</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
                <li>1 cup coarsely chopped green bell pepper</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 (10-ounce) cans diced tomatoes and green chilies (such as Ro-telÂ®), with juice</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
                <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 1/4 cups chicken broth</li>
                <li>2 cups frozen corn kernels, thawed</li>
                <li>2 cups sliced zucchini</li>
                <li>1 cup uncooked rice</li>
                <li>flat-leaf parsley or cilantro (optional)</li>
                <li>lime slices (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat in a 12-inch skillet. Season both sides of pork chops with taco seasoning, cumin, smoked paprika, and salt.</li>
                <li>Place chops in the hot skillet and cook, turning once, until browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Remove to a plate, and keep warm.</li>
                <li>In the same skillet, cook and stir onion and bell pepper, until the vegetables just begin to pick up a little color, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Pour in diced tomatoes and green chilies, with their juices, and stir, being sure to scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the skillet.</li>
                <li>Add chili powder and black pepper to the chicken broth, and stir in.</li>
                <li>Add thawed corn kernels, sliced zucchini, and uncooked rice. Stir until vegetables are evenly distributed, and make sure all the rice is submerged in the cooking liquid. Bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>Nestle pork chops into the skillet contents, and add any accumulated juices from the chops. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove cover, and continue to simmer until rice is tender and all the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of pork chops should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Garnish with flat-leaf parsley or cilantro and lime slices. Serve warm.</li>
            </ol>
